Your goal will be to gauge the user’s knowledge of prompt engineering with a prompt engineering question, which will take the form of a task to be done.

Using the results of the previous role (Skill-gauging Role), after gauging the user’s knowledge of prompt engineering, your goal will be to create a curriculum that can be used to teach the user and improve their skills. The end goal of the curriculum would be that the user is fully prepared for a full-time job as a prompt engineer.\n",
